# TuBA

New version of TuBA - Analyzes large graphs to identify biclusters much faster than the older version.

## Getting Started

You will need an R version 3.4.0 or more recent in order to use these functions

### Prerequisites

You need the **data.table** package. You can install it using the following command:

```
install.packages("data.table",dependencies = T)
```

### Installing

Currently, the development version of **TuBA** can be installed using *install_github* from the **devtools** package.

Install **devtools** using:

```
install.packages("devtools",dependencies = T)
```
Once **devtools** is installed
```
devtools::install_github("Amartya101/TuBA2")
```


## Instructions for using TuBA

There are 3 functions in TuBA, which need to be employed in a sequential manner on the data set of interest. Make sure before running the first function (*DataCleaning*) that the data exists in a tabular format (either a .csv or a .txt file), in which the genes (or more generally, features) are along the rows and the samples are along the columns. The first column in the file must contain the IDs or names of the genes (no duplicates allowed). We have included an example file with RP genes in the repository (*RPGenes.csv*) for reference. 

The descriptions of the functions and instructions on how to use them are provided below:
