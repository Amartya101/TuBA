# TuBA - Enhanced Version

New version of TuBA - Analyzes large graphs to identify biclusters much faster than the older version.

## Getting Started

You will need an R version 3.4.0 or more recent in order to use these functions

### Prerequisites

You need the data.table package. You can install it using the following command:

```
install.packages(data.table,dependencies = T)
```

### Installing

The development version of TuBA2 can be installed using install_github from the **devtools** package (install_github is actually sourced from the **remotes** package which is also installed as one of the dependencies of **devtools**

Install **devtools** using:

```
install.packages(devtools,dependencies = T)
```

```
remotes::install_github("Amartya101/TuBA2")
```
